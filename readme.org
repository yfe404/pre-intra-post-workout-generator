** Draft (just a reminder for me, don't pay attention)

*** Before (30min to 1h) 

blend of carbs and proteins => should be in digestion when you start working out => aminos and sugar in your blood = energy

tips: powders are easier to break down


**** Proteins 

between 20 and 40g depending on your weight and distance from the last meal

good one: 50% whey, 50% casein or lean meat (chicken, turkey, white fish)

whey only if your workout starts in less than 1h



**** Carbs

30-70g (on avg) 
- if solid: without fiber (more digestible)
- if powder (and low budget) => maltodextrin 
- if you need more than 70g of carbs during your workout, take waxy or vitargo 
- if you are shredding take high glycemic index carbs, moderate else (eg oats powder)






*** During 

**** Proteins 

Hydrolysat is the only protein that can stop catabolism during the workout (particularly useful if you haven't took a pre workout)
take at half the workout (beware of digestive troubles)

**** Carbs

Drink all along the workout session

- High GI only ! 

On avg 60g of carbs per hour disolved in 800ml-1l of water. Typically maltodextrin


You may want to add 10-15g of potassium bicarbonate  

Also you can add: 

- 5-10g of BCAA (depending on how long the session is)


*** After

- levels of leucin must be satisfying
- the protein source must be digestible fast
- you must eat enough proteins
- the insulin must reach a certain thresh 

the adequate dose of proteins is between 40g plus 5g of leucin IFF you didn't take BCAA's during the workout 

you can take hydrolysat or whey (doesn't really matter but whey is usually cheaper) - don't take proteins powder if the next meal 
is in less than 1h30 after the end of the workout (you may take the leucin anyway)
